# Masha's AI 



Meet **Masha's AI** – a fun, Masha and the Bear–themed conversational AI voice agent that listens, understands, and responds to you in real-time, both in **text** and **voice** form.  

The persona of the agent is **Masha**, the mischievous little character from the cartoon *Masha and the Bear*.  
When you click the 🎙️ mic button, you can talk to her directly, and she will respond in her unique voice and personality.

##  Task Overview
- Updated the README.md with **newly added features**  
- Documented integration of:  
  - **News API** – delivers trending news in a funny “Masha-style” narration  
  - **Roast Mode** – when triggered by keywords like *roast, roast yourself, make fun*, Masha responds with a witty roasted reply  
- Ensured clear explanation of client-side and server-side functionality  
- Extended dependency list to include **News API** integration

##  How It Works

###  Client Side
- Clicks mic button to record audio  
- Streams audio chunks to the server using **WebSockets**  
- Displays the response in **text form**  
- Plays back the response in **voice form** in real time  

###  Server Side
- Receives and buffers audio chunks from client  
- Sends audio to **AssemblyAI** for transcription (STT)  
- Passes transcribed text to **Google Gemini LLM** to generate response  
- Stores conversation history for context retention  
- Converts response text into speech using **Murf AI**  
- Detects **roast trigger words** (like “roast yourself” / “make fun of yourself”) and switches to roast mode  
- Fetches **news updates** via **News API** and delivers them in a funny, playful style
