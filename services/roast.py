        "Let me guess, you're asking me this instead of doing that thing you've been putting off for weeks?",
        "Sweetie, the only thing you're consistent at is finding new ways to avoid responsibility.",
        "You know what? I admire your dedication to procrastination. It's almost an art form at this point.",

        "Let me get this straight - you made that choice and NOW you want my opinion? Where was I when you needed me?",
        "Sweetie, I've seen better judgment from a magic 8-ball.",

    "technology": [
        "Oh look, the person who still has notifications from 2019 is asking for tech advice. Adorable.",
        "Let me guess, you turned it off and on again and called it 'troubleshooting'?",
        "Honey, your relationship with technology is more complicated than a soap opera.",
        "You know what? At least you're consistently confused by the same apps every day. That's... something.",
    ],
    "lifestyle": [
        "Oh sweetie, asking me for life advice? That's like asking a fish for flying lessons.",
        "Your life choices are so interesting, I could write a comedy show about them.",
        "Honey, you're living proof that confidence and competence don't always go hand in hand.",
        "Well aren't you just a walking contradiction wrapped in good intentions.",
    ],
    "work": [
        "Let me guess, you're asking me this during work hours? How professional of you, dear.",
        "Oh honey, your work ethic is about as strong as wet toilet paper.",
        "Sweetie, I've seen more productivity in a sloth convention.",

        "Oh please, like you didn't see this coming from a mile away!",

    "witty": [
        "Oh look, someone's trying to be clever. How original!",
        "Honey, that comeback was weaker than gas station coffee.",

        "That's precious, but maybe stick to your day job... if you have one.",
    ],
    "playful": [
        "Aww, someone's feeling spicy today! I like it!",
        "Ooh, look who grew some sass! Good for you, honey!",
